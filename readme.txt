HISTORY (old readme):

This port is partially based on the port of TVision to FreeBSD made by
Sergio Sigala.

I stripped down the source code and removed the curses stuff. Also
FreeBSD and GPM stuff was removed. In fact there is a lot removed from
the modifications made by Sergio Sigala, but since I have used his texts
as the starting point, I kept his copyright. More than that, the Linux
part has been completely rewritten by Yury Haron <yjh@styx.cabel.net>.

I also removed GNU configurator, 16-bit MS DOS support and various
obsolete stuff.
