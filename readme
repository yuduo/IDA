WinGraph_qt - Graph Visualization Tool for MS Windows
====================================================

WinGraph_qt tool reads a textual and readable specification of a graph and
visualizes the graph. It layouts the graph using several heuristics as
reducing the number of crossings, minimizing the size of edges, centering of
nodes. The specification language of WinGraph_qt is GDL, Graph Description
Language.

WinGraph_qt is a port of the WinGraph32 tool which in turn is a port of the
VCG tool to MS Windows. Some functionality has been removed during the porting
process.


COMPILATION
===========

WinGraph_qt builds on Windows using msvc/nmake, Linux using g++/gmake
and OS X using g++/make.  A Qt development environment with qmake is
required.  WinGraph_qt expects the Qt libraries to have been built
using QT_NAMESPACE QT (similar to Ida) and will link just fine
against the Qt4 libraries that ship with Ida.  The build process is
as follows:

Windows:
qmake -o Makefile.msvc wingraph.pro -platform win32-msvc2008
nmake -f Makefile.msvc

Linux:
qmake -o Makefile wingraph.pro -platform linux-g++
gmake

OS X:
qmake -o Makefile wingraph.pro -platform macx-g++
make

We prepared build.* files for your convenience.

INSTALLATION
============

No special installation prodecure is required because WinGraph_qt consists
of one executable file. Copy it to any directory you like.


USAGE
=====

Run WinGraph_qt by specifying the input file in the command line:

        WinGraph_qt input-file.gdl

The input file should be a text file describing the graph.

WinGraph_qt supports one additional command line switch:

  -remove       removes the input file after parsing it

For the whole list of the command line switches, please refer to
the original VCG tool documentation:

or visit the VCG site on the web:
